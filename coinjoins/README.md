# Coinjoins & Privacy UX Primer

- Bitcoin is not anonymous.
- Consider each address you generate as a new identity.
- Coin has history
- Histories can link addresses into clusters
- Public ledger
- Anyone can lookup
- New users may not be aware

## Address Reuse

Use a [hierarchical deterministic wallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deterministic_wallet) in order to avoid reusing an identity.

Practicality

- How do you adverise an address to be paid in a video?
- Handling gap limit, online and during recovery

## Wallet Fingerprinting

The way the transaction is constructed can give chain analysts an idea of which wallet was used.

1. Change is sometimes the last output
   1. Solutions
      1. [Lexicographical Ordering (BIP 0069)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0069.mediawiki) (see also [arguments against, search for bip 69 in transcript](https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-05-05-socratic-seminar-payjoins/))
      2. Random Ordering - is there a standard? verifiable? deniable?
2. If the `nLockTime` in the transaction or `nSequence` of the inputs are set
  - locktime type (absolute/`nLockTime`, [relative/`nSequence` (BIP 68)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki), and their [interactions](https://b10c.me/mempool-observations/1-locktime-stairs/))
  - locktime value type (blockheight, [MTP (BIP 113)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki))
  - [RBF opt in (BIP 125)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki)

## Routing Transaction

- Should use Tor
  - Research Dandelion
- If an attacker has enough nodes in the network it can determine the location of where the transaction was broadcasted.

## Methods

### Coinswap

Privacy through a swap for another users coin history.

### Coinjoins

Privacy by combining of coin history.

#### Censoring

- Some exchanges may not accept deposits from coinjoins
- Adding hops â€” *see Samourai Wallet's Ricochet*

#### Components

##### Rounds

- Role of the coordinatior

##### Coin Selection

- Post-mix wallet MUST prevent joining inputs together. [cite_1]

#### Techniques

Types of coinjoin techniques...

##### Equal Output Coinjoin

- All parties mix the same output denominations

##### PayJoin

A type of coinjoin which involves two parties adding their inputs, and outputs on the same transaction so the direction of payment cannot be determined.

- is not obviously visible as an equal-output [CoinJoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CoinJoin)

> If [PayJoin transactions](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/PayJoin) became even moderately used then it would make the [common-input-ownership heuristic](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Common-input-ownership_heuristic) be completely flawed in practice. As they are undetectable we wouldn't even know whether they are being used today. As [Transaction surveillance companies](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_surveillance_company) mostly depend on that heuristic, as of 2019 there is great excitement about the PayJoin idea.
