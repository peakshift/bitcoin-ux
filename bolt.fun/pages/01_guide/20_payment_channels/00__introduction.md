# Payment Channels

If two parties want to make payments between themselves often, they can lock up some funds together in an on-chain transaction. Then they are able to bypass recording their subsequent payments with one another on-chain, by instead keeping track of each of their bitcoin balances in Lightning.

This is known as a payment channel, Lightning is essentially a network of payment channels which a senderâ€™s payment can be routed through to reach any other beneficiary.
