# Invoice Variations

Aside from the standard lightning invoice, there are a number of different variations of invoices that a user can potentially send to coerce different types of transactions. These work by playing with the different primitives of an invoice to tease out certain unique types of behaviors.

Generally, the following cover the different variations, and eac page explains how that particular variation is constructed and what new capabilities it enables:
- [HODL Invoice](/guide/invoices/variations/hodl-invoice)
- [Keysend](/guide/invoices/variations/keysend)
- [Multi-part Payments](/guide/invoices/variations/mpp)
- [Lightning Offers](/guide/invoices/variations/lightning-offers)
